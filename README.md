# Python_Instacart Project Analysis
Project analysis using python  to analysis Instacart sales patterns to derive insights on its market segmentations to purpose business strategies to stakeholder to aid in better segmentation.
## Objective
Instacart stakeholders interested in the variety of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. Stakeholders want a targeted marketing strategy as Instacart stakeholders know a single marketing strategy will not fit all customers. They want to target different customers with specific marketing campaigns to see what effect there is on the sales of Instacart products. This analysis will answer key stakeholder questions to see ensure the appropriate customer profiles are targeted with the appropriate products. 
## Key Questions
1) The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
2) They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
 3) Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
 4) Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
5) The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
     -What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
     -Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
     -Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
     -Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
      habits?
     -What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
      Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
     -What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
      profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
      customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
